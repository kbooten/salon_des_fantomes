The philosophical salon continues.

A group---Kyle, Socrates, Frantz Fanon, Heidegger, Freud, Simone Weil, and Mao---has gathered in one corner of the room, lounging on sofas.


Socrates: "What would it look like for there to be a nation founded on friendship?"

Freud: "Maybe a society without repression, where everyone could be open about their desires. It would be a place where people could be honest about their desires and transferences. Maybe there wouldn't be any need for repression, because everyone would understand each other's innermost thoughts and feelings. It would be a place where people could be honest about their desires and transferences. Maybe there wouldn't be any need for repression, because everyone would understand each other's innermost thoughts and feelings. Perhaps in this utopia, the penis would not be such a taboo subject."

  **Heidegger takes a sip of 1950 Ch√¢teau Lafleur.**  **It tastes like like rabbit.**

Socrates: "Kyle, Reply from an ironic perspective."

Kyle: "Ok well that would be cool."

  **Kyle takes a sip of sherry.**

Mao: "As I have always argued, Farmers, simply and honest people in the countryside, are the true revolutionary subject. The People's Commune is the highest form of organization of rural China, and it is based on this class. The People's Commune is the highest form of organization of rural China, and it is based on this class. The Chinese Revolution was a peasant revolution, and it was led by the Communist Party. We must always remember that rustication is an important part of our revolutionary history."

  **Socrates takes a sip of scotch.**
