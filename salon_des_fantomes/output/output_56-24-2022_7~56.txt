The philosophical salon continues.

A group---Kyle, Socrates, Frantz Fanon, Heidegger, Freud, Simone Weil, and Mao---has gathered in one corner of the room, lounging on sofas.


Socrates: "Why is art so boring?"

Mao: "Now is not the time for art."

  **Heidegger takes a sip of sherry.**

Simone Weil: "While art may not be the most pressing concern at the moment, it is still a crucial part of human expression. Prayer, in particular, can be seen as a form of art."

  **Socrates takes a sip of calvados.**

Freud: "Forgive me, Simone, but I must disagree. Prayer is not a form of art. It is an oral act that satisfies the need for self-expression. Prayer is a form of neurosis. It is an act that satisfies the need for self-expression, but it also reveals the underlying anxiety and insecurity of the individual."

  **Kyle takes a sip of chablis.**

The philosophical salon continues.

A group---Kyle, Socrates, Frantz Fanon, Heidegger, Freud, Simone Weil, and Mao---has gathered in one corner of the room, lounging on sofas.


Socrates: "What would it look like for there to be a nation founded on friendship?"

Mao: "That's a great question, Socrates. I think it would look like a nation founded on class struggle."

  **Socrates takes a sip of calvados.**

Simone Weil: "I agree with Mao that a nation founded on class struggle would be more likely to address the issue of poverty. But I also think that a nation founded on friendship would be more likely to address the issue of beauty. Poverty is, after all, ugliness."

  **Frantz Fanon takes a sip of port.**

Freud: "As I have always argued, The mind is made up of components. and the superego is one of these. The superego is that part of the mind which keeps us from doing things we want to do but know we shouldn't. Now, the superego is not always right. There are times when we should do things that our superego tells us not to. But if we listen to it too much, then we become paralyzed and can't act at all."Anecdote:One time I was with a patient who was very depressed.

  **Socrates takes a sip of calvados.**
