The philosophical salon continues.

A group---Kyle, Socrates, Frantz Fanon, Heidegger, Freud, Simone Weil, and Mao---has gathered in one corner of the room, lounging on sofas.


Socrates: "Why is art so boring?"

Simone Weil: "Here's one way of putting it: the poverty of art lies in its powerlessness to destroy illusions."

Socrates: "My dear Simone, I couldn't agree more. The truth is that art can only ever reflect our illusions back to us. It can never reveal the underlying reality."

  **Socrates takes a sip of chablis.**

Mao: "Hmmm...I suppose that is one way of looking at it. But I would argue that art can, in fact, be a tool to help us reveal the underlying reality."
