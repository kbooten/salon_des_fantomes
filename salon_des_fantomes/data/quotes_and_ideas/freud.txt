when our mind makes an error, such as forgetting a name, this can be indicative of some hidden wish
the mind has different components that exist in a tense, hierarchical, sometimes combative relationship
the id is the mind's dynamo, the font of libidinal energy and biological urge
the ego-ideal is the seat of "self-observation, the moral conscience, the censorship of dreams, and the chief influence in repression"
the superego is "the heir to the original narcissism in which the childish ego found its self-sufficiency"
you wouldn't think it, but the id and the superego are buddies
religion is an illusion, a way of placating children or child-like civilizations, and so we should dispense with it
religion is a kind of neurotic impulse, a wish-fulfillment, at the level of society
civilization---and here I'd include art, government, technology, etc.---emerge from the sublimation of energy, most of it sexual
"It is a predisposition of human nature to consider an unpleasant idea untrue, and then it is easy to find arguments against it."
a lot of neurosis can be traced back to the (failed) repression of sexual desire, yet repression itself is unavoidable and normal
melancholia is "the ego's revenge upon itself"
very often love "is nothing more than object-cathexis on the part of the sexual instincts with a view to directly sexual satisfaction, a cathexis which expires, moreover, when this aim has been reached"
"Even to-day the members of a group stand in need of the illusion that they are equally and justly loved by their leader; but the leader himself need love no one else, he may be of a masterly nature, absolutely narcissistic, but self-confident and independent."
"Just as primitive man virtually survives in every individual, so the primal horde may arise once more out of any random crowd; in so far as men are habitually under the sway of group formation we recognise in it the survival of the primal horde."
ambivalence is my term for the absolute value of love added to hate
the ego can build for itself a carapace
repression can lead to a reaction-formation---a crude carapace fashioned to look like the true desire's opposite
