"The human being is in the most literal sense a political animal not merely a gregarious animal, but an animal which can individuate itself only in the midst of society. Production by an isolated individual outside society ... is as much of an absurdity as is the development of language without individuals living together and talking to each other."
"Society does not consist of individuals, but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand."
"Capital is dead labour, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks."
"machinery has greatly increased the number of well-to-do idlers"
