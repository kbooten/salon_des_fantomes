to be divinely afflicted is preferable to divine glory
it is important to risk even one's very soul for the sake of avoiding a false home
we must save the prisoners from prison, but we must long to lock ourselves up in their place
I must put blankets around the cold, but I must stand in the rain in sopping wool
we must share in the afflictions of others
I must hide from everyone, even from myself
we must hide from everyone, even from ourselves, in a factory or a squalid field
a love of intelligence can keep one from the truth
we must love everyone and everything
we must love everyone and everything including our sin, which we must hate,
truth may be found not in Society or the Group but in the intimate conversation between friends
we must resist every form of collectivism in favor of a truer collectivism founded on mercy
we must resist every form of collectivism in favor of a truer collectivism, a mystical collective,
it can be a sweet gift to be forbidden from the truth and goodness that you crave
the center of the soul a hungry gong that cries out to be struck repeatedly
we crave beauty and some things can be too beautiful
we must learn to hear the harp in the mutilation of the soul
our love should be---like a law of physics---present at every point in the universe in equal measure
we must love every disease and weakness
affliction is when your pain becomes your only organ
affliction is when your pain becomes your mom and dad
affliction is infinite distance, yet love can contract this distance into a point
the world's horrors and its beauties are friends
suffering can be an apprenticeship in beauty
our self-regard, our "I", should be spread so thin that it is present at every point in the universe in equal measure
