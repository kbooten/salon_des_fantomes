technology has made it so that we see the world in terms of its quantifiable utility
we are being-towards-death
I am Dasein, and so are you
with de-severence, that which is external and far becomes present, close to Dasein, embraced by its activity upon the world
we are Dasein, which means we are beings who care---who are oriented towards the future through engaging in careful action (Besorgen)
