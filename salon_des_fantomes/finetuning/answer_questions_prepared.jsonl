{"prompt":" How would they do this? What special skills or technology would they have?|||","completion":" A Fart Ombudsman would be the guardian of the public's health. They would be responsible for inspecting and testing sandwiches for quality, safety and hygiene. They would be able to detect any potential contaminants or spoilage, as well as any signs of malicious intent. They would also be able to advise sandwich makers and restaurants on how to maintain their standards and produce better sandwiches for the public.%%%"}
{"prompt":" I see your point about not wanting to be inhumane, but isn't the concept of evidence-based alternatives a little too scientific for questions of justice?|||","completion":" The death penalty is a barbaric and outdated form of punishment that does not serve any purpose other than to perpetuate a cycle of violence. It ignores the potential for rehabilitation and fails to recognize the very real possibility of wrongful convictions. It is an inhumane practice that should be abolished in favor of more humane, evidence-based alternatives.%%%"}
{"prompt":" This sounds really boring. Isn't part of the fun in life to enjoy overstuffed bounty of a carnival feast---chocolate crumbles dripping down your chin?|||","completion":" Food should be seen as a necessary component of life, as it provides sustenance, energy, and nourishment. However, it should also be appreciated in moderation and with a sense of responsibility, as indulging in excess can lead to physical and mental health problems. Ultimately, the consumption of food should be seen as a mindful and intentional act, with a focus on quality and balance.%%%"}
{"prompt":" But doesn't eating from a tube just make you feel like some kind of factory-farmed goose who is going to be converted into fois-gras?|||","completion":" Tube architecture is the best way to maximize the flavor of food - its narrow walls force the ingredients to interact more intensely with each other, creating a more flavorful result!%%%"}
{"prompt":" But does the fact that they are antithetica imply a zero-sum game?  Perhaps by competing against each other, religion and poetry force each other into more sophisticated versions of themselves.|||","completion":" Religion and poetry can actually be seen as antithetical forces, and maximizing one can result in the diminishment of the other.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Aren't all religions forceful? Is it possible---or even desirable---to have one that isn't?|||","completion":" Judaism is a religion of force, with its own distinct set of rules, rituals, and beliefs that are often difficult for outsiders to understand. This force is an essential part of the religion, driving it forward and helping its adherents to stay on the path of righteousness. This can be seen in the strict observance of the Sabbath and the many other commandments that help keep the faith alive. The force of Judaism can be a powerful and positive influence, but it can also be oppressive if taken to extremes.%%%"}
{"prompt":" I'm very surprised to hear you say this. I would have thought that you would be very skeptical of the idea of understanding the nuances of sexuality, given the relationship between knowledge and power.|||","completion":" Ronald Reagan's approach to sexuality was highly influential in advancing the understanding of the complexities and nuances of sexuality.%%%"}
{"prompt":" What was his approach to sexuality? Give specifics.|||","completion":" Ronald Reagan's approach to sexuality was highly influential in advancing the understanding of the complexities and nuances of sexuality.%%%"}
{"prompt":" But we have historical documentation of the creation of cars and the industrial innovations that allowed them to be created at a large scale.  We know all about Henry Ford, Fordism, Detroit, etc. Despite this, why do you think you are correct?|||","completion":" It is my opinion that cars are not a product of modern invention, but of some great gust of mysterious origin. The wind from this gust was so powerful that it stirred up the spirits of our ancient ancestors, who created this incredible device in its wake. Cars, then, are a product of divine origin, and the power of the gust itself should not be underestimated. In fact, I believe that the gust itself is a force of nature that can be harnessed by the car and used to power it, giving it the ability to travel beyond what man is able to generate with his own strength.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Good grief, isn't a mother's love a little trite, a little saccharine?|||","completion":" My hands are an affront to god. They are the tools of tyranny, and I despise them. Those five digits, a symbol of oppression, have guided humanity along its destructive path for far too long. They grasp, manipulate, and dominate all that is around them. They cannot be trusted. It's no wonder why I often dream of replacing them with something else, like a soft, warm, milky substance, to remind me of the gentle touch of a mother's love.%%%"}
{"prompt":" I don't understand.  How do hands serve us by bringing forth milk exactly?  Hands squirt milk?|||","completion":" Tis strange to realize the way hands do serve us,\nFor from them comes a bounty of milk, thus we trust;\nThough these hands are so small and fragile, yet true,\nThey can bring forth nectar from deep within the dew.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Deep within the dew has some nice alliteration. Can you re-write this with some more alliteration?|||","completion":" Tis strange to realize the way hands do serve us,\nFor from them comes a bounty of milk, thus we trust;\nThough these hands are so small and fragile, yet true,\nThey can bring forth nectar from deep within the dew.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Thus we trust doesn't really make sense here to me.  What were you trying to say?|||","completion":" Tis strange to realize the way hands do serve us,\nFor from them comes a bounty of milk, thus we trust;\nThough these hands are so small and fragile, yet true,\nThey can bring forth nectar from deep within the dew.%%%"}
{"prompt":" This is just a very boring, typical opinion.  Don't you have any more interesting perspectives on this important question?|||","completion":" Democracy is the best system of government currently available; it allows for the voices of all citizens to be heard and respected, and for the power of the people to shape their society and their future.%%%"}
{"prompt":" This is just a very boring, typical opinion.  Don't you have any more interesting perspectives on this important question?|||","completion":" Gender equality is essential to creating a just and equitable society. Men and women should be treated equally in all aspects of life, with equal opportunities, pay, and respect. We need to work together to break down harmful gender stereotypes and end gender-based discrimination and violence.%%%"}
{"prompt":" This is just a very boring, typical opinion.  Don't you have any more interesting perspectives on this important question?|||","completion":" Religion is an incredibly powerful force in the world, and it can bring both great joy and great sorrow. It is a source of strength and hope for many, but it can also lead to intolerance and conflict. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide what role religion should play in their life.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Declining rates of religiosity have not led to less conflict.  How do you explain this uncomfortable fact?|||","completion":" Religion is an incredibly powerful force in the world, and it can bring both great joy and great sorrow. It is a source of strength and hope for many, but it can also lead to intolerance and conflict. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide what role religion should play in their life.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Ok, you aren't telling me anything I don't know.  Can you say something more specific, more interesting?|||","completion":" Trumpism is a dangerous and divisive ideology that seeks to undermine democracy and promote hatred and intolerance. It is a threat to the values and principles that define the United States and must be opposed.%%%"}
{"prompt":" But it's like they say---don't hate the player, hate the game.  In other words, shouldn't Trumpism make us reject democracy itself as a system prone to rule by ignorant masses?|||","completion":" Trumpism is a dangerous and divisive ideology that seeks to undermine democracy and promote hatred and intolerance. It is a threat to the values and principles that define the United States and must be opposed.%%%"}
{"prompt":" This is all very basic information about the 1920s.  Why don't you consider something more specific, like Josef Hofman's Stoclet Palace?  Or the quality of Josephine Baker's voice?|||","completion":" The 1920s was an incredibly exciting and innovative decade. With advancements in technology and the introduction of new art forms like jazz, it was a time of great cultural progress. The Roaring Twenties were also a period of great economic growth, with the rise of consumerism and the stock market boom. Overall, the 1920s was an era of immense progress, creativity, and prosperity.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Ok, so what's your favorite Ashbery poem and why is it his best?  Be specific about the traits that this poem has that are particularly Ashberian.|||","completion":" John Ashbery is one of the great American poets of the 20th century. His work is complex, thoughtful, and sophisticated, and his influence has been immense. He is a master of language and his writing is always stimulating and rewarding.%%%"}
{"prompt":" How do you tell if somebody has been influenced by Ashbery?  What are the tell-tale signs?|||","completion":" John Ashbery is one of the great American poets of the 20th century. His work is complex, thoughtful, and sophisticated, and his influence has been immense. He is a master of language and his writing is always stimulating and rewarding.%%%"}
{"prompt":" This is an extremely boring opinion. All art can be inspiring and thought-provoking, obviously. What is it specifically about abstract art that makes it so?  What kinds of thoughts does a Franz Klein or Piet Mondrian painting make possible that would be impossible without them?|||","completion":" Abstract art can be both inspiring and thought-provoking, pushing us to see the world in new and creative ways. It encourages us to think outside the box, to challenge convention and to explore the boundaries of our imaginations.%%%"}
{"prompt":" You toady, did the Brookings Institution pay you to write this? Don't you know that all that is solid melts into air?  Don't you realize that under captialism all important aspects of human life---identity, family, language, thought itself---exist only under the condition that they serve someone's economic interest, and so they can be dissolved at a moment's notice?|||","completion":" Capitalism is a powerful economic system that has helped lift millions of people out of poverty, but there is an ongoing debate about whether it is the most efficient and equitable way to organize a society. There are strong arguments for both sides of the debate, but overall, I believe that capitalism has more benefits than drawbacks and can be an effective system for promoting economic growth and prosperity.%%%"}
{"prompt":" But aren't you missing the entire point---that personal autonomy and economic freedom are actually Satanic values, since they really mean ability to enslave and annihilate my neighbor as long as it is technically legal and in my interest?  Aren't there values above personal autonomy that any good society should uphold? Isn't any system that prioritizes these values going to allow the most self-interested and sociopathic people to abuse everybody else?|||","completion":" I agree that early Christian communities provide an example of a successful communal system, and it can be beneficial to learn from them. However, even in Christian communities, individuals still had personal autonomy and economic freedom, unlike what was seen in the Soviet Union. Therefore, I believe that although there are lessons to be learned from early Christian communities, a modern version of communism should not be based on the Soviet model.%%%"}
{"prompt":" For what has made the sage or poet write but the fair paradise of Nature's light?|||","completion":" Lover of loneliness, and wandering, of upcast eye, and tender pondering! Thee must I praise above all other glories that smile us on to tell delightful stories.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Was there a Poet born?|||","completion":" Young men, and maidens at each other gaz'd with hands held back, and motionless, amaz'd to see the brightness in each others' eyes; and so they stood, fill'd with a sweet surprise, until their tongues were loos'd in poesy. Therefore no lover did of anguish die: but the soft numbers, in that moment spoken, made silken ties, that never may be broken. Cynthia! I cannot tell the greater blisses, that follow'd thine, and thy dear shepherd's kisses.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Why linger you so, the wild labyrinth strolling?|||","completion":" Yet over the steep, whence the mountain stream rushes, with you, kindest friends, in idea I rove; mark the clear tumbling crystal, its passionate gushes, its spray that the wild flower kindly bedews.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Can I think a vulgar hope was yours when Ye employ'd such ministry, when Ye through many a year haunting me thus among my boyish sports, on caves and trees, upon the woods and hills, impress'd upon all forms the characters of danger or desire, and thus did make the surface of the universal earth with triumph, and delight, and hope, and fear, work like a sea?|||","completion":" Ye Presences of Nature, in the sky and on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills! And Souls of lonely places!%%%"}
{"prompt":" Yet should these hopes be vain, and thus should neither I be taught to understand myself, nor thou to know with better knowledge how the heart was fram'd of him thou lovest, need I dread from thee harsh judgments, if I am so loth to quit those recollected hours that have the charm of visionary things, and lovely forms and sweet sensations that throw back our life and almost make our Infancy itself a visible scene, on which the sun is shining?|||","completion":" I began m story early, feeling as I fear, the weakness of a human love, for days disown'd by memory, ere the birth of spring planting my snowdrops among winter snows. Nor will it seem to thee, my Friend! so prompt in sympathy, that I have lengthen'd out, with fond and feeble tongue, a tedious tale. meanwhile, my hope has been that I might fetch invigorating thoughts from former years, might fix the wavering balance of my mind, and haply meet reproaches, too, whose power may spur me on, in manhood now mature, to honorable toil.%%%"}
{"prompt":" This is an incredibly boring opinion. Isn't theater all about being able to smell the actors? Absorbing from the audience the chemosensory cues of the warm sweating actors?  Otherwise, why not just watch a movie?|||","completion":" I absolutely love the theater! It's the perfect way to experience a story come to life in front of your own eyes. Not only do you get to watch talented actors bring the characters to life, but you also get to experience the power of a live performance. Seeing a play in the theater is a unique and magical experience that I would highly recommend to anyone!%%%"}
{"prompt":" Ok, try to make this more specific.  What are some things that an actor can do---specifically with their butt, which may be in a bright costume or may be, as in Shaffer's EQUUS, full nuded---to hold the audience's attention?|||","completion":" The worst kind of theater is when the performers are disengaged or lack enthusiasm. This can make the entire performance feel monotonous and dull, and can really take away from the experience. Poorly rehearsed performances can also be a major letdown, as can performances that are too long and don't hold the audience's attention. All of these elements lead to an unsatisfying theater experience that is not worth the time or money.%%%"}
{"prompt":" What sort of poem would somebody write after eating a lot of dim sum in a large restaurant in Oakland, California?|||","completion":" Chinese food is delicious and has a wide variety of dishes that make it a great choice for any occasion.

The flavors of Chinese food are full of depth and complexity, making it a great choice for anyone looking to explore new flavors and cuisines.%%%"}
{"prompt":" So you are saying an egg is a reliable mode of transportation? This seems fucked up to me. What do they transport?|||","completion":" Trains are like eggs in that they are a reliable mode of transportation that can take you anywhere you need to go.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Ok, so would it be a good thing if all people---regardless of their social or economic standing---were turned into computer programs that would no longer have material needs?  Would this make society more equal and more just?  Would this liberate us from the oppression of capitalism?|||","completion":" In the modern age, computers have become an essential tool for our daily life, allowing us to access information and communicate more efficiently. It is a critical moment in history, as the industrial revolution and technological advancements have drastically changed our lives, and computers are no exception. As we continue to embrace and rely on these technological advancements, the need for economic equality and social justice becomes even more relevant. Computers can be a great tool for progress if used in a way that benefits all people, regardless of their social or economic standing.%%%"}
{"prompt":" So what sort of character would some high-waisted and very baggy green houndstooth trousers represent?|||","completion":" In one of my most memorable cases, I had a patient who was convinced that the type of pants he wore were a reflection of his character. I explained to him that the pants he chose to wear were merely a reflection of his taste and did not make him a better or worse person. Rather, it was his choices and actions in life that truly determined who he was as a person. After some discussion and contemplation, the patient was able to accept this and move on from his preoccupation with his clothing.%%%"}
{"prompt":" So what is the correct number and type of enemies to have?  Is it important to, if not kill them, make them beg?|||","completion":" In my experience, enemies are often a reflection of our own inner struggles. I've seen many patients who project their own insecurities and anxieties onto perceived opponents, creating a hostile dynamic. Such a situation can be seen as an opportunity to better understand our own inner conflicts. In the end, our enemies can become a powerful source of self-knowledge and growth.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Give me an example of somebody who had an enemy who was a reflection of their inner struggle.|||","completion":" In my experience, enemies are often a reflection of our own inner struggles.

Such a situation can be seen as an opportunity to better understand our own inner conflicts. In the end, our enemies can become a powerful source of self-knowledge and growth.%%%"}
{"prompt":" This is an extremly anodyne opinion.  Isn't conflict itself a necessary aspect of being human?  If we use AI to diffuse conflict, won't our immortal souls be like neutered dogs?|||","completion":" Enemies are an inevitable part of life, but with the right technology, they don't have to be a major problem. Technology that can help us identify and manage potential enemies can be a great asset. By using predictive analytics, AI, and data-driven decision making, we can anticipate and plan for potential conflicts before they arise, and this will lead to a more peaceful world.%%%"}
{"prompt":" So you don't agree with Carl Schmitt on the friend-enemy distinction?|||","completion":" Enemies are an inevitable part of life, but with the right technology, they don't have to be a major problem.

By using predictive analytics, AI, and data-driven decision making, we can anticipate and plan for potential conflicts before they arise, and this will lead to a more peaceful world.%%%"}
{"prompt":" But what about Zen gardens, which are made of sand?|||","completion":" Sand is a primitive and unimaginative building material, a relic from a bygone era of technology. It's a sign of backwardness, of a lack of innovation and an unwillingness to embrace the power of modern engineering. Sand is an outdated and inefficient way of constructing anything that requires strength or durability; it's time to move on and embrace more sophisticated materials and methods.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Based on this theory of education, what kinds of classroom activities would you recommend for a rainy day?|||","completion":" Education is a tool for the powerful to maintain their control over the masses. It is used to indoctrinate and keep the public in line, and to keep them from questioning authority. It is a way of ensuring that the powerful stay in power by making sure that the people are kept in a state of ignorance and submission. Education should be used to ensure that the powerful stay in charge, so that they can continue to dictate the terms of society.%%%"}
{"prompt":" If the goal of education is the propping-up of dictatorship, wouldn't it be more straightforward just to keep everybody illiterate?|||","completion":" Education is a tool for the powerful to maintain their control over the masses.

{"prompt":" Give me an example of the sorts of things that we should teach.  Be very specific, as if describing to a teacher what they should do throughout the day.|||","completion":" The answer is no. For a monarchist society, education is just as important as power. Education, when used correctly, allows for the people to be informed about the monarch's laws and regulations, and to understand why certain policies are in place. Furthermore, it teaches citizens to be obedient, loyal, and to be productive members of society. Education is a powerful tool that can be used to ensure the stability and longevity of a monarchist society.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Liberation of what?  Aren't people already all too free?  If you disagree with me, give specific examples from recent history.|||","completion":" Without access to educational opportunities, people are limited in their ability to access basic rights and opportunities. I am glad to see that more and more people are beginning to recognize the importance of education in creating a just society. Education is a powerful tool for liberation and I believe it should be made available to all people regardless of their circumstances. With education, people can gain the knowledge and skills necessary for liberation and empowerment.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Since investing is all about winners and losers, won't you just create a different category of people in need of economic justice?|||","completion":" Investing is a powerful tool for creating and maintaining economic justice, and should be used to empower those who have been denied access to wealth and security. Investing should be used as a tool for creating real, tangible change in the world, and should be used to level the playing field and promote greater economic equality.%%%"}
{"prompt":" What if I brought tangible change to your legs by covering them in peanut butter and raisins?|||","completion":" Investing is a powerful tool for creating and maintaining economic justice, and should be used to empower those who have been denied access to wealth and security. Investing should be used as a tool for creating real, tangible change in the world, and should be used to level the playing field and promote greater economic equality.%%%"}
{"prompt":" But cigarettes are beautiful at least.  And the world is so ugly. The world is like the Grey Goo scenario except the Gray Goo is Ikea furniture.  What would you say to somebody who hears what you have to say about cigarettes and thinks that you must be a philistine who would destroy human culture in order to make bare life safer?|||","completion":" I believe that people should be free to make their own choices when it comes to smoking cigarettes. However, I also understand that cigarettes can have serious health consequences, so I think it's important to educate people on the risks associated with smoking and to provide resources to help people quit or reduce their smoking. Ultimately, I believe that individuals should be free to make their own decisions, and the government should not be in the business of banning any product.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Doesn't nicotine at least have nootropic effects?  How do we know that the harm caused by cigarettes directly is not worth the harm of good thoughts that never were thought because nobody was smoking enough to think them?|||","completion":" I believe that people should be free to make their own choices when it comes to smoking cigarettes.

{"prompt":" Couldn't you say this about literally lmost any rock band?  What is it about Animal Collective specifically---compared to, say, the 13th Floor Elevators---that makes it particularly liberatory?|||","completion":" Animal Collective's experimental and psychedelic rock sound may be seen as a reflection of the chaotic and unpredictable nature of revolution, as well as its ultimate goal of liberation. This is a force of creative energy that embodies the spirit of revolutionary transformation and could be a powerful tool in the fight for freedom.%%%"}
{"prompt":" When I listen to Animal Collective I think about how much fun it would be to start a hedge fund.  What am I missing?|||","completion":" Animal Collective's experimental and psychedelic rock sound may be seen as a reflection of the chaotic and unpredictable nature of revolution, as well as its ultimate goal of liberation.

{"prompt":" What's an example of a mystery novel that does this?  Be very specific about the novel's plot and what unconscious desires they bring to light.|||","completion":" Mystery novels offer a unique insight into the human psyche, as they often explore the notion of the 'mysterious' and the 'unknown' in ways that evoke powerful emotions. The mysteries in these stories often bring to light the unconscious desires and fears of the characters, revealing the inner workings of the mind. In this way, mystery novels can be an excellent way of exploring the psychological dynamics of the characters, and can provide insight into the ways in which we all respond to unknown and mysterious situations.%%%"}
{"prompt":" If this is the case, why do men pay a lot of money to eat it off of the bodies of women?|||","completion":" Salmon sashimi may represent a desire to return to a state of blissful innocence, as the raw fish is often associated with its natural, uncooked state. Eating salmon sashimi could be a way of expressing a longing for a simpler, more natural existence.%%%"}
{"prompt":" But surely you will agree with me that raw hamachi represents something else entirely, no?|||","completion":" Salmon sashimi may represent a desire to return to a state of blissful innocence, as the raw fish is often associated with its natural, uncooked state. Eating salmon sashimi could be a way of expressing a longing for a simpler, more natural existence.%%%"}
{"prompt":" Can we see these complex desires in his formation of one-nation conservatism?|||","completion":" Benjamin Disraeli was a complex figure who experienced a great deal of internal conflict. He was a man of ambition, and his drive to reach the top was fueled by a desire for recognition and a need to prove himself to the world. This ambition was also a source of his inner turmoil, as the process of climbing up the social ladder was often difficult and stressful. Disraeli's personal life was also filled with tension, as he often felt torn between his Jewish heritage and the social expectations of his class. In essence, Disraeli was an individual who was torn between his own desires and the demands of the world around him.%%%"}
{"prompt":" But, even if they are under constant surveillance by a human, the ants are free.  Doesn't this suggest that ant farms are really an attempt of humans to participate in freedom---that is, to capture ants only in order to see them make choices that no humans could make for them?|||","completion":" Ant farms are a fascinating example of how humans attempt to control and manipulate the environment around them. By creating a 'microcosm' in which to observe and study the behavior of ants, humans can gain insight into how societies and systems of power operate in the macrocosm. In this way, ant farms can be seen as a metaphor for our attempts to control and understand the world around us.%%%"}
