{"prompt": " A Fart Ombudsman would be the guardian of the public's health. They would be responsible for inspecting and testing sandwiches for quality, safety and hygiene.

{"prompt": " The death penalty is a barbaric and outdated form of punishment that does not serve any purpose other than to perpetuate a cycle of violence. It ignores the potential for rehabilitation and fails to recognize the very real possibility of wrongful convictions. It is an inhumane practice that should be abolished in favor of more humane, evidence-based alternatives.%%%", "completion": " I see your point about not wanting to be inhumane, but isn't the concept of \"evidence-based alternatives\" a little too scientific for questions of justice?|||"}
{"prompt": " Food should be seen as a necessary component of life, as it provides sustenance, energy, and nourishment.

{"prompt": " Religion and poetry can actually be seen as antithetical forces, and maximizing one can result in the diminishment of the other.%%%", "completion": " But does the fact that they are \"antithetica\" imply a zero-sum game?  Perhaps by competing against each other, religion and poetry force each other into more sophisticated versions of themselves.|||"}
{"prompt": " Judaism is a religion of force, with its own distinct set of rules, rituals, and beliefs that are often difficult for outsiders to understand. This force is an essential part of the religion, driving it forward and helping its adherents to stay on the path of righteousness. This can be seen in the strict observance of the Sabbath and the many other commandments that help keep the faith alive. The force of Judaism can be a powerful and positive influence, but it can also be oppressive if taken to extremes.%%%", "completion": " Aren't all religions \"forceful\"? Is it possible---or even desirable---to have one that isn't?|||"}
{"prompt": " Ronald Reagan's approach to sexuality was highly influential in advancing the understanding of the complexities and nuances of sexuality.%%%", "completion": " I'm very surprised to hear you say this.

{"prompt": " It is my opinion that cars are not a product of modern invention, but of some great gust of mysterious origin. The wind from this gust was so powerful that it stirred up the spirits of our ancient ancestors, who created this incredible device in its wake. Cars, then, are a product of divine origin, and the power of the gust itself should not be underestimated. In fact, I believe that the gust itself is a force of nature that can be harnessed by the car and used to power it, giving it the ability to travel beyond what man is able to generate with his own strength.%%%", "completion": " But we have historical documentation of the creation of cars and the industrial innovations that allowed them to be created at a large scale.  We know all about Henry Ford, Fordism, Detroit, etc. Despite this, why do you think you are correct?|||"}
{"prompt": " My hands are an affront to god. They are the tools of tyranny, and I despise them. Those five digits, a symbol of oppression, have guided humanity along its destructive path for far too long. They grasp, manipulate, and dominate all that is around them. They cannot be trusted.

{"prompt": " I agree that early Christian communities provide an example of a successful communal system, and it can be beneficial to learn from them. However, even in Christian communities, individuals still had personal autonomy and economic freedom, unlike what was seen in the Soviet Union. Therefore, I believe that although there are lessons to be learned from early Christian communities, a modern version of communism should not be based on the Soviet model.%%%", "completion": " But aren't you missing the entire point---that \"personal autonomy and economic freedom\" are actually Satanic values, since they really mean \"ability to enslave and annihilate my neighbor as long as it is technically legal and in my interest\"?

Isn't theater all about being able to smell the actors? Absorbing from the audience the chemosensory cues of the warm sweating actors?  Otherwise, why not just watch a movie?|||"}
{"prompt": " The worst kind of theater is when the performers are disengaged or lack enthusiasm. This can make the entire performance feel monotonous and dull, and can really take away from the experience. Poorly rehearsed performances can also be a major letdown, as can performances that are too long and don't hold the audience's attention. All of these elements lead to an unsatisfying theater experience that is not worth the time or money.%%%", "completion": " Ok, try to make this more specific.
